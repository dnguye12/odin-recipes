            <p>Piping hot and perfectly salted.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Russet potatoes</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with cleaned and peeled russet potatoes that you have cut into 3/8-inch "match sticks."</li>
                <li>Place in bowl of very cold water: keep rinsing and changing the water until the water is clear; drain thoroughly and dry with paper towels or a clean lint-free kitchen towel.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, you preheat your hot oil to 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Place prepared taters in oil and cook about 5 minutes. They will have that blond-tone color to them.</li>
                <li>Note: Once you add cold potatoes to the hot oil, the temperature of your oil is going to drop - you want it to be somewhere between 330 - 325 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Remove from oil; drain and cool.</li>
                <li>Now - either refrigerate until ready to finish cooking, or cool completely and freeze up to 3 months. To freeze properly - place completely cooled fries in single layer on tray and place in freezer until frozen. Then bag them.</li>
                <li>To finish cooking - preheat your oil to 400* F. Add your cold fries (which will drop the oil temp - which is fine because you want it near the 375 degrees F. temp) and cook a few minutes until done.</li>
                <li>Lightly salt them and shake well so that the salt distributes well and they are not salty.</li>
                </ol>
